# core.async Talk Resources

This repository contains the demo portion of a talk I plan to give at Unified 
Diff on core.async. It's heavily inspired by [David Nolen's hs-async](https://github.com/swannodette/hs-async)
repository.

## Usage

```
lein cjlsbuild auto ud-async
```

Then open the _index.html_ file in your browser.
